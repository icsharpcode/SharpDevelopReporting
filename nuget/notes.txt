Build Process
=============

1. Copy the following pre-built files to this location:

    lib\net45

Do not copy any Irony or PdfSharp files.
These are available as NuGet packages so do not need be included.

2. Update the sdr.nuspec with the new version and release information.

If you want to test a pre-release version change the version so the latest digit contains a string:

   1.0.1-alpha
   1.0.1-alpha.2
   1.0.1-beta
   1.0.1-beta.2

2. Run buildpackage.cmd


Publishing Process
==================

1. Ensure that you have configured your api key for nuget.org using a command line similar to:

    nuget setapikey 4003d786-cc37-4004-bfdf-c4f3e8ef9b3a

Your apikey is available from https://www.nuget.org/account

2. Make sure the only .nupkg file in the same containing deploy.cmd is the one you want to publish.

3. Run deploy.cmd
